/*
 * This module describes the value-level of specifically de-serialization. (There is a related module for specifically 
 * serialization. At the heart of this description is a function deserialize, which is somehow derived by the mapper from the XML
 * types (or the corresponding OO types) such that deserialization may map an XML document to an object graph with the suitable
 * correspondence and conformance relationships.
